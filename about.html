                    <div class="info__content">
                        <p class="text">Teaching higher-level English can be a grind sometimes, huh?</p>
                        <p class="text">Hi! My name is Irene and I'm here to share the teaching materials I've been pouring my heart into. They’ve completely changed the game for me, and I truly believe they can do the same for you.</p>
                        <p class="text">Having been a teacher myself for quite a while, at some point in my life I just made up my mind to start designing my own classes as I reached a breaking point—I was done with endless prep, last-minute tweaks, and outdated content. No matter how much I searched, nothing ever seemed to fully meet my needs—I was constantly piecing things together, structuring lessons from scratch, and hunting for extra materials. Don’t get me wrong—there are a bunch of solid textbooks out there, let alone other ready-made materials already available online—and yet it always felt as if something was missing.</p>

                        <div class="info__image-row">
                            <div class="image image_1"><img src="dist/img/about-1.jpeg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
                            <div class="image image_2"><img src="dist/img/about-2.jpeg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
                        </div>

                        <p class="text">But ever since I started applying these resources in my own classroom, the biggest benefit I’ve gained was peace of mind. I no longer have to invest hours into prepping, stress over what I should be teaching next, or scramble to create new activities. I’m simply doing what I love to do - teaching.</p>
                        <p class="text">Let me give you a peek into the structure of these classes. Each one kicks off with a warm-up activity that not only helps your students grasp what’s coming up but also gives you, as the teacher, a snapshot of their existing knowledge. Then, depending on the focus, you’ll dive deeper into either vocabulary or grammar—always with plenty of speaking practice built in. On top of that, your students will engage with real-world articles, texts, and videos, so they see the language in action, not just in theory.</p>
                        <p class="text">Each lesson is designed to be flexible. You can stretch it across three or four separate classes, reinforcing the material until your students absorb it naturally—no rote memorization required.  By incorporating discussions and a variety of activities throughout these sessions, they’ll absorb the content naturally and effortlessly.</p>

                        <div class="info__image-row">
                            <div class="image image_3"><img src="dist/img/about-3.jpeg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
                            <div class="image image_4"><img src="dist/img/about-4.jpeg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
                        </div>

                        <p class="text">In addition to that, these resources are highly adaptable—you can tweak them with ease, adding or removing words, grammar topics, additional materials as needed.</p>
                        <p class="text">You can even also bundle them into a cohesive course, seamlessly transitioning from one topic to the next, switch between grammar and vocabulary, weightier subjects and lighter ones, tailoring the experience to your students’ unique life circumstances and needs.</p>
                        <p class="text">Every class comes with a variety of homework assignments to choose from, plus a Quizlet set to help students review and reinforce what they’ve learned at home.</p>
                        <p class="text">Think of this as your complete toolkit for teaching higher-level English—one that frees you from the grind of lesson planning and lets you focus on what truly matters: inspiring your students and watching them grow.</p>
